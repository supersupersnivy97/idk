Hello, thank you for purchasing noobhax!

(you have to copy lua5.1.dll in the Roblox directory everytime Roblox updates and also you have to download the latest noobhax DLL)

Now that you've whitelisted yourself with the whitelister program, follow these steps.

1. Get lua5.1.dll from https://github.com/supersupersnivy97/idk/raw/master/lua5.1.dll

(make sure Windows doesn't rename it to lua5.1 (1).dll or something else, if you already have it you can use it without redownloading: 
the filename must be exactly lua5.1.dll)

2. Copy it in the current Roblox directory:

%localappdata%\Roblox\Versions\version-0bb91d28bcd0467c

To access it, press Win+R and copy-paste that then press OK (or Enter key)

3. Get the latest noobhax.vmp.dll from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I5U9omsbyq6g4cpQu3iyjS6W4iJgVWQH/view?usp=sharing

4. Get a DLL injector if you don't have one

If you need one, here it is https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4wgf6amXsJBDs2uqRZkMJXp_RkAf6mM/view?usp=sharing

5. Join a Roblox game, open your DLL injector, select RobloxPlayerBeta.exe process, select noobhax DLL (noobhax.vmp.dll) and click Inject!

Enjoy

If noobhax doesn't show up even after you copied lua5.1.dll correctly and your antivirus isn't blocking you, download Visual Studio 2015 redistributable x86 from http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=48145
